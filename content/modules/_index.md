* [EssentialsX AntiBuild](http://wiki.mc-ess.net/wiki/AntiBuild): Use permissions to control who can build on your server
* [EssentialsX Protect](/modules/protect): Configure basic rules for your server, such as mob spawning, lava flow, creeper damage and more
* [EssentialsX GeoIP](/modules/geoip): Add GeoIP lookups to EssentialsX, allowing you to see roughly where a user is logging in from
